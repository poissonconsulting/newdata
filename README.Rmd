## Introduction

`newdata` is an R package to generate new data frames by varying some variables while holding the others constant.

By default, all specified variables vary across their range 
while all other variables are held constant at a reference value.
The user can specify the length of each sequence, require that only
observed values and combinations are used and add new variables.
Types, classes, factor levels and time zones are always preserved.

Consider the following observed 'old' data frame.
```{r}
library(newdata)

newdata::old_data
```

### Length of Sequences

By default all variables are set to a reference value.
```{r}
xnew_data(old_data)
```

Specifying a variable causes it to vary sequentially across its range.
```{r}
xnew_data(old_data, int)
```

The user can specify the length of each sequence.
```{r}
xnew_data(old_data, xnew_seq(int, length_out = 3))
```

### Observed Values and Combinations

The user can also indicate whether only observed values should be used in the sequence.
```{r}
xnew_data(old_data, xnew_seq(int, length_out = 3, obs_only = TRUE))
```

The `xobs_only()` function can be used to filter out unobserved values after the sequence has been generated.
```{r}
xnew_data(old_data, xobs_only(xnew_seq(int, length_out = 3)))
```

When two or more variables are specified all combinations are used.
```{r}
xnew_data(old_data, int, fct)
```

To only get observed combinations use `xobs_only()`
```{r}
xnew_data(old_data, xobs_only(int, fct))
```

### Add New Variables

Adding a new variable is simple.
```{r}
xnew_data(old_data, extra = c(TRUE, FALSE))
```

### Casting Variables

Casting variables to be the same class as the original is achieved as follows.
```{r}
xnew_data(old_data, xcast(int = 7, dbl = 10L, fct = "a rarity"))
```
