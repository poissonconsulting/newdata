\title{Generate New Sequence}
\usage{
new_seq(x, length_out = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The object to generate the sequence from.}

\item{length_out}{The maximum length of the sequence.}
}
\value{
A vector of the same class as the object.
}
\description{
Generate a new sequence of values for a vector, matrix or array.
A sequence of value is used to predict the effect of a variable.
}
\examples{
# by default the sequence of values for objects of class numeric
# is 30 evenly space values across its range
new_seq(c(1,4))
# missing values are always removed
new_seq(c(1,4, NA))
# unless it's the only value
new_seq(NA_real_)
# or the object is zero length
new_seq(numeric())
# the length of the sequence can be varied using the length_out argument
new_seq(c(1,4), length_out = 1)
# which can even be 0
new_seq(c(1,4), length_out = 0)
# for integer objects the sequence is by default up to 30 unique
# integers across the range
new_seq(c(1L,4L))
# for character objects by default its the
new_value(c("a", "b", "c", "c"))
# and the minimum of the most common values if a tie
new_value(c("a", "b", "c", "c", "b"))
# for factors its the first level and factor levels are always preserved
new_value(factor(c("a", "b", "c", "c"), levels = c("b", "a", "g")))
# for ordered factors its also the first level
new_value(ordered(c("a", "b", "c", "c"), levels = c("b", "a", "g")))
# for dates it's the rounded mean
new_value(as.Date(c("2000-01-01", "2000-01-04")))
# it's also the rounded mean for times
new_value(hms::as_hms(c("00:00:01", "00:00:04")))
# for POSIXct vectors it's the rounded mean and the time zone is preserved
new_value(as.POSIXct(c("2000-01-01 00:00:01", "2000-01-01 00:00:04"),
  tz = "PST8PDT"))
# for logical objects it's always FALSE
new_value(logical())
# and finally by default its simply the mean
new_value(complex(real = c(1, 4)))
