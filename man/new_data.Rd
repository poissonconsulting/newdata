\title{Generate New Data}
\usage{
new_data(
  data,
  seq = character(0),
  ref = list(),
  obs_only = list(character(0)),
  length_out = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data frame to generate the new data from.}

\item{seq}{A character vector of the variables in \code{data} to generate
sequences for or a named integer vector of the maximum length for each
sequence where each name is the respective variable.}

\item{ref}{A named list of vectors to add to the new data frame.
The variables must not be in
\code{seq} but they do not need to be in \code{data}.}

\item{obs_only}{A character vector specifying the
character, factor, and ordered (factor) variables in \code{seq} that
should only be represented by their unique combinations or a list
of character vectors specifying the groupings of character, factor
and ordered (factor) variables in \code{seq} that should each only
be represented by their unique combinations.
If \code{TRUE} it is set to be all character, factor,
and ordered (factor) variables specified in \code{seq}.}

\item{length_out}{A count indicating the maximum length of sequences for all
types of variables except character, factor and ordered factors.
If the maximum length for each variable is specified in \code{seq}
then \code{length_out} is ignored.}
}
\value{
A tibble of the new data.
}
\description{
Generates a new data frame (in the form of a tibble) with each variable
held constant or varying as a unique ordered sequence.
All possible unique combinations are included and the columns
are in the same order as those in data with new columns added from
\code{ref}.
}
\details{
It is worth noting that \code{ref} can be used to specify reference values
as well as sequences.
The \code{ref} argument is useful for introducing new variables,
overriding the default reference values, extrapolating outside
the range of the data and/or changing the levels of a factor
or time zone of a POSIXct vector.
If an element of \code{ref} is a character vector and the corresponding
column is a data frame, then the ref element is assigned the same
factor levels as the column in the data. This is useful for choosing
a factor level without having to set the correct levels.

\examples{
# an example data set
data <- tibble::tibble(
  vecint = c(1L, 3L),
  vecreal = c(1, 3),
  vecchar = c("b", "a"),
  vecdate = as.Date("2001-01-01", "2001-01-01"))

# vary count while holding other values constant
new_data(data, "vecint")
# vary continual
new_data(data, "vecreal")
new_data(data, c("vecchar", "vecint"))
