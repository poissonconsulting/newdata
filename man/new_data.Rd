\title{Generate New Data}
\usage{
new_data(
  data,
  seq = character(0),
  ref = list(),
  obs_only = list(character(0)),
  length_out = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data frame to generate the new data from.}

\item{seq}{A character vector of the variables in \code{data} to generate
sequences for.}

\item{ref}{A named list of reference values for variables that are not in seq.}

\item{obs_only}{A list of character vectors indicating the sets of variables
to only allow observed combinations for.
If TRUE then obs_only is set to be seq.}

\item{length_out}{A count indicating the maximum length of sequences for all
types of variables except logical, character, factor and ordered factors.}
}
\value{
A tibble of the new data.
}
\description{
Generates a new data frame (in the form of a tibble) with each variable
held constant or varying as a unique ordered sequence.
All possible unique combinations are included and the columns
are in the same order as those in \code{data}.
}
\details{
If an element of \code{ref} is a character vector and the corresponding
column is a data frame, then the ref element is assigned the same
factor levels as the column in the data. This is useful for choosing
a factor level without having to set the correct levels.
}
\examples{
# an example data set
data <- tibble::tibble(
  vecint = c(1L, 3L),
  vecreal = c(1, 3),
  vecchar = c("b", "a"),
  vecdate = as.Date(c("2001-01-01", "2001-01-01"))
)

# vary count while holding other values constant
new_data(data, "vecint")
# vary continual
new_data(data, "vecreal")
new_data(data, c("vecchar", "vecint"))
