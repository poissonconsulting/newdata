\title{Generate New Reference Value}
\usage{
new_value(x, obs_only = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The object to generate the reference value from.}

\item{obs_only}{A flag specifying whether to only use observed values.}
}
\value{
A scalar of the same class as the object.
}
\description{
Generate a new reference value for a vector, matrix or array.
A reference value is used to control for a variable
during predictions.
}
\details{
The reference value for objects (vectors, matrices or arrays)
of class numeric is the mean.
Missing values are always removed
unless it's the only value
or the object is zero length.
For integer objects it's the rounded mean.
For character vectors it's the most common value
and the (locale-dependent) minimum of the most common values if a tie.
For factors and ordered factors it's the first level and
the factor levels are preserved.
For dates and hms vectors it's the rounded mean.
For POSIXct vectors it's the rounded mean and the time zone is preserved.
For logical objects it's always \code{FALSE} as this is
the natural reference value.
And finally by default it's simply the mean.

\examples{
# the reference value for objects of class numeric is the mean
new_value(c(1, 4))
# missing values are always removed
new_value(c(1, 4, NA))
# unless it's the only value
new_value(NA_real_)
# or the object is zero length
new_value(numeric())
# for integer objects it's the rounded mean
new_value(c(1L, 4L))
# for character objects it's the most common value
new_value(c("a", "b", "c", "c"))
# and the minimum of the most common values if a tie
new_value(c("a", "b", "c", "c", "b"))
# for factors its the first level and the factor levels are preserved
new_value(factor(c("a", "b", "c", "c"), levels = c("b", "a", "g")))
# for ordered factors its also the first level
new_value(ordered(c("a", "b", "c", "c"), levels = c("b", "a", "g")))
# for dates it's the rounded mean
new_value(as.Date(c("2000-01-01", "2000-01-04")))
# it's also the rounded mean for times
new_value(hms::as_hms(c("00:00:01", "00:00:04")))
# for POSIXct vectors it's the rounded mean and the time zone is preserved
new_value(as.POSIXct(c("2000-01-01 00:00:01", "2000-01-01 00:00:04"),
  tz = "PST8PDT"
))
# for logical objects it's always FALSE
new_value(logical())
