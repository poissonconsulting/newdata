\title{New Value}
\usage{
new_value(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The vector to generate the new value for.}
}
\value{
A scalar of the same class as the vector.
}
\description{
Generate a new reference value for a vector.
}
\details{
The reference value is the value to use for a variable when it is being
held constant.
}
\examples{
# the reference value for real vectors is the mean
new_value(c(1,4))
# missing values are always removed
new_value(c(1,4, NA))
# unless its the only value
new_value(NA_real_)
# or the vector is zero length
new_value(numeric())
# for integer vectors it's the rounded mean
new_value(c(1L,4L))
# for character vectors it's the most common value
new_value(c("a", "b", "c", "c"))
# and the minimum of the most common values if a tie
new_value(c("a", "b", "c", "c", "b"))
# for factors its the first level and factor levels are always preserved
new_value(factor(c("a", "b", "c", "c"), levels = c("b", "a", "g")))
# for ordered factors its also the first level
new_value(ordered(c("a", "b", "c", "c"), levels = c("b", "a", "g")))
# for dates it's the rounded mean
new_value(as.Date(c("2000-01-01", "2000-01-04")))
# it's also the rounded mean for times
new_value(hms::as_hms(c("00:00:01", "00:00:04")))
# for POSIXct vectors it's the rounded mean and the time zone is preserved
new_value(as.POSIXct(c("2000-01-01 00:00:01", "2000-01-01 00:00:04"),
  tz = "PST8PDT"))
# for logical vector it's always FALSE as this is the natural reference value
new_value(TRUE)
new_value(logical())
# by default its simply the mean
new_value(complex(real = c(1, 4)))
