\arguments{
\item{x}{The object to generate the reference value from.}
}
\value{
A scalar of the same class as the object.
}
\description{
Generate a new reference value for a vector, matrix or array.
A reference value is used to control for a variable
during predictions.
}
\details{
The reference value for objects (vectors, matrices or arrays)
of class numeric is the mean.
Missing values are always removed
unless it's the only value
or the object is zero length.
For integer objects it's the rounded mean.
For character vectors it's the most common value
and the (locale-dependent) minimum of the most common values if a tie.
For factors and ordered factors it's the first level and
the factor levels are preserved.
For dates and hms vectors it's the rounded mean.
For POSIXct vectors it's the rounded mean and the time zone is preserved.
For logical objects it's always \code{FALSE} as this is
the natural reference value.
And finally by default it's simply the mean.
