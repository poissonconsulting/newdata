Description: Generates new data frames for passing to predict functions.
    In the new data the column or columns of interest vary across their range
    while the remaining columns are held constant at their reference value.
    The reference value for a factor is its first level,
    while the reference level for columns of other types are the mean
    or rounded mean in the case of logicals, integers, Dates or POSIXcts.
