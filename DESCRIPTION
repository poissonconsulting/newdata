Description: Generates new data frames for passing to predict functions.
    In the new data the column or columns of interest vary across their
    range while the remaining columns are held constant at their reference
    value.  The reference value for a factor is its first level, while the
    reference level for columns of other types are the mean in the case
    of real vectors, rounded mean in the case of logical and integer vectors and
    floored mean in the case of Dates and POSIXct vectors.
